## About Me


I am a current junior at St. Olaf College studying Psychology and International Relations. After I graduate from St. Olaf, I hope to go to graduate school to pursue a degree in Industrial-Organizational Psychology. Outside of class, I am a figure skater in the St. Olaf figure skating club and a member of the Norseman Band. In my free time, I enjoy reading, baking, traveling, hiking, and spending time outside!
