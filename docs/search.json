The map of the United States is plotted on a grid with longitude plotted on the x-axis, ranging from -125 to -65, and latitude on the y-axis ranging from 25 to 50. States are colored on a scale, ranging from dark purple to yellow, based on their total number of deaths. Number of deaths range from 0, which is depicted by a dark purple, to 250000 deaths, which is a bright yellow color. States that have larger populations, such as California, have higher total deaths than states with smaller populations, such as North Dakota. Overall, this trend shows that states with larger populations tend to have a higher total number of deaths because as population increases, number of deaths also proportionally increases.\nManipulating data and joins\n\nsf_use_s2(FALSE)\n\n#Creates a dataframe with total number of deaths by state for join with states_sf\n\ndeath_total_upper &lt;- causes_of_death |&gt;\n  rename(cause = \"Cause Name\", \n         state = State, \n         deaths = Deaths) |&gt;\n  filter(Year == \"2017\", \n         cause == \"All causes\") |&gt;\n  filter(state != \"United States\") |&gt;\n  select(deaths, state)\n\n#Joins the states_sf dataset  with the death_total_upper dataframe to find total number of deaths by state in an interactive map\n\ndeath_total_sf &lt;- states_sf |&gt;\n  filter(!(name %in% c(\"Alaska\", \"Hawaii\", \"Puerto Rico\"))) |&gt;\n  left_join(death_total_upper, by = c(\"name\" = \"state\"))"

To start, we could demonstrate some simple analysis through plots as well as some statistical skills. These skills could include joining with another data set, checking correlations, and p-values. All of these things could help us to make a prediction for a potential March Madness winner based on the data found.

For our analysis, we chose the top five winning teams from the selected conferences. From this, the colors represent these selected conferences while the teams are displayed above their respective statistics. From this graph, we can see that Duke for this season has the highest overall and conference winning percentage, while the other two teams in the selected conferences that represent the rank of one for this year’s championship tournament (Florida & Auburn) are of slightly lower percentage. This also brings up an interesting point as St. John’s has a higher percentage for both conference and overall and were seeded at a number two ranking. Without the results of this championship, this would suggest a solid point to the committee for the selection of these rankings. In addition, it appears that the Big East conference season for these selected five teams are on average to play at a lower level of overall and conference performance with one outlier being St. John’s, which could also weigh in on selection rankings as well. From this analysis, it is intriguing to see the relationship between the overall percentage and the conference percentage and how it may be able to inform real decisions and could perhaps be used as a tool for the perfect bracket."

    "text": "Conclusion\nIn conclusion, this evaluation provides insights into future analysis that can and may be conducted when it comes to looking at overall and conference performance. It began with the table scraping methods that were used from the data of the NCAA’s website of the College Men’s Basketball Standings. From there, the use of cleaning the data and bringing this data into a clear and concise table to where further analysis can be conducted on it become pertinent. Through the use of plots, we further demonstrated that the relationship between overall performances and conference performances has intriguing insights when it comes to ranking selections. This analysis serves as an approach and can be used more in depth to help with the ranking selection as well as the prediction for brackets if used on a larger scale."
